## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: RESTful APIs are scalable because the requests between client and server are 						
			stateless/isolated from each other
		
Answer for Question 2: resources provided by the mail server include the mail received by a client 	
			
Answer for Question 3: the PUT method is not used on the mail server. Perhaps it can be implemented 
			by adding a new recipient or sender address (updating sender, or CC'ing
			 someone)?
Answer for Question 4: API keys provide an application authorization and identification when calling 
			the API and can therefore associate the data being sent from the API to a specific project.
